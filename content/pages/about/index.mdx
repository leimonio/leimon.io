Hi 👋 my name is Konstantinos, I'm a software engineer 🤖, currently working for DAZN, a live and on-demand video streaming service for sport events.

Really enjoy working with the Javascript stack using React & NodeJS.

I'm a Greek 🇬🇷 currently living in London 🇬🇧 where I realised that sun, cloud and rain 🌦 or even snow can actually happen simultaneously.

After being a coffee lover ☕️ for a long time, my recent favourite hobby is brewing espresso at home

Snowy mountains 🏔 combined with snowboard and good friends are among my favourite destinations.
