My name is Konstantinos, a 27 years old software engineer 🤖, working for [Hostmaker](https://hostmaker.com/) as a full-stack engineer, on the Javascript stack using NodeJS, React, Redux. 
I recently moved in 📍Bristol (UK) no matter how much I appreciate sunny weather ☀️, like there used to be in my hometown, Athens (Greece) 🏖.

My background comes from a typical CS graduate degree, that started with programming in Java, moved to PHP, Javascript and Python.
Throughout my professinal experience I have developed skills around creating, developing and consluting user-centric products.

I love travelling and exploring new destinations, and i'm keen in sports like snowboarding.
