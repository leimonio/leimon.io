### Web development on mobile never was that easy

Google Chrome offers **Developer Tools**, having that way access into the internal of the browser.

Ever wanted having such tools that will help your **development process on mobile**? Chrome does it in a very efficient way.

Through its tool it allows you to inspect, debug, and analyze the on-device experience with the full suite of tools you’re used to, meaning you can use the Chrome DevTools on your development machine to debug a page on your mobile device.

How to debug your web content and applications on mobile?

What you will need are:

1. An Android device with Chrome.

1. A USB cable to plug the device to your development machine.

1. The [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) or [ADB Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adb/dpngiggdglpdnjdoaefidgiigpemgage) installed on your development machine.

For the installation process follow the next steps:

1. Make sure you have installed the Android SDK or the ADB chrome plugin.

1. Enable usb debugging on your device. Settings > Developer Options > USB debugging.
(In the latter version of Android developers options are hidden by default. To enable them go to Settings > About Phone and tap Build number 7 times.)

1. Connect your device via USB to the development machine.
On your mobile device, launch Chrome and enable the USB debugging settings, going to Settings > Advanced > DevTools > Enable USB Web debugging.

1. Now you can start debugging with your ADB Chrome extension. Start ADB and then View Inspect Targets list will contain your device’s open addresses.

You can now inspect and follow the development process as on your development machine. Inspect the address you want to debug and you are ready. A new window with the Chrome DevTools will appear, while your mobile browser’s document elements will be highlighted.
