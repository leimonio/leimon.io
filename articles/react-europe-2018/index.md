# React Europe 2018  ‚öõÔ∏è üá™üá∫ - TLDR & Resources

### Yay - What a week and what a sexy conference! üî•

Last week I visited React Europe and it was really amazing! The speakers, the presentation, the attendants were great! It makes you feel much more motivated being part of this community!

React ecosystem seemed quite mature and many libraries get updated and modernized. Opinions and experimental implementations that are to further be developed and discussed got presented from the speakers. Conference talks embodied particular subjects that were prevalent throughout them, along with the future of React. 

### So here we are, a sum up! 

### Main topics and highlight on React Europe 2018 ‚ö°Ô∏è
* ReasonML &amp; Static/Runtime type systems, integrations with React Components 
* React Native, Universal Components (platform agnostic)
* Œïxperimentations such as porting React Native back to Web that blowed up our minds ü§Ø
* Libraries and tools getting revamped and updated to newer versions -- Apollo GraphQL, React Native Navigation, CodeSandbox

Day 2 - 

## ReasonReact and local state - Cristiano Calcagno
### 
- Statically typed programming language (OCAML)
- compiles to Javascript
- powerful type inference
### Reason React - write components in Reason
- type safe
- state always initialized
- no direct access of state
- explicit side effects
- integrates with the rest of the system
- demos
- presentation


## Full Stack React Navigation - Eric Vicenti
- react navigation v2 showcase
- urls are navigation actions e.g. my-app://OverviewTab/?id=LessonA
- demos
- presentation
- @ericvicenti 

## A year of CodeSandbox - Ives van Hoorne
- really cool and motivating on OSS

## Immutable Application Architecture - Lee Byron
- cool reference to architecure and vetruvius (vtilitas, venvstas)
- fundamental structural choice -> choosing elements of abstractions
- power vs principles
- declarative abstractions with principles
- IDEA - Immutable, Declarative, Executable, Architecture (can found in Elm)
